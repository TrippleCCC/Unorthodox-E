    <h2>About Unorthodox-Eats</h2>
    <p>
      Unorthodox-Eats aims to bring awareness to the issue of food insufficiency, especially in the state of Texas.
      The project was cultivated in July 2018 and has been growing since.
    </p>
    <h2>About Food Insufficiency in Texas</h2>
    <p>
      The USDA defines food insecurity as a state in which “consistent access to adequate food is limited by a lack of money and other resources at times during the year.” Good shorthand terms for food insecurity are “struggling to avoid hunger,” “hungry, or at risk of hunger,” and “hungry, or faced by the threat of hunger.”
      <br>
      According to the latest USDA report, 14.3% of Texas households (one in seven) experienced food insecurity in the years 2014-2016. Texas was one of just fifteen states with higher food insecurity than the nation during this period. In raw numbers, 1.4 million Texas households were food insecure, more than almost any other state.

    <p>
      The Central Texas Food Bank has been at the front line of hunger relief with the help of  Partner Agencies in 21 counties across Central Texas. Together, we provided more than 45 million pounds of food to families in need during the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the largest amount distributed since the organization’s establishment in 1982, when only 330,000 pounds of food was provided.
